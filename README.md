manymatch
=========

A string matcher built off of minimatch that matches a string against a series of patterns.

I haven't gotten to the documentation yet. I built this to make it easy to work with url matching for server constraints but because it's a super thin layer on top of minimatch, it has a lot more capability. For now, take a look at the https://github.com/bzuillsmith/manymatch/test/test.manymatch.js for some examples.

Thanks to Isaac Schlueter for the great minimatch module! https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch/
